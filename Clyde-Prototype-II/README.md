## Clyde Hotel Green Roofs Project

### Goals

The goal of the project is to develop a trusted _data sharing ledger_ for food plants 
growing on the Carlton Hotel roof. The project acts as a case study and a laboratry for
exploring blockchains, data and the means for dealing with the _on-chain_ and _off-chain_ 
worlds. The three organisations involved are: (*1*) The Clyde Hotel; (*2*) Penta; and 
(*3*) The University of Melbourne and specifically the Faculty of _Food and Agricultural
Science_.

The Clyde roof consists of roughly three areas: (1) North facing peaked roofs; (2) a 
roof-top bar area; and (3) a large lower flat roofed area on which are currently a number 
of photo-voltaic cells. 

1.  **From the point of view of the Clyde Hotel** - The project will map temperature and 
humidity, light, wind-speed and relevant gases like carbon-monoxide and dioxide to build 
up composite vector fields for the roof. The Clyde will use the sensor data to assess 
micro-climates, growing conditions and the best types of plants to use for the roof garden.  

The blockchain's role is to maintain a trusted shared ledger of the data monitoring 
the growing conditions, environment and actions taken to manage the plants. The 
network can also be accessed by patrons to verify food quality.

2.  **From the point of view of the University of Melbourne** - The project will 
provide the PoC and data to assess micro-climates in urban environments. 

3.  **From the point of view of Penta and CCP** - The project will provide: (*1*) a public 
demonstration that Penta has the technical capabilities for developing the blockchain 
combining data, sensors and IoT for supply chains; (*2*) a working system on which to run 
experiments and try ideas; (*3*) open up a potential new use for blockchains. The outcome here 
will be a visualisation as for (1) but also we should try to put a visual presentation around 
the sensor network that will highlight the supply chain potential.

### Clyde Prototype II

The focus for **CP II** is to explore interaction with a fabric running on the IBM cloud.
